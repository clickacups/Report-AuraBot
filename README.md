When the plugin is first ran, the config will automatically set an AuraBot Report value (default 3), this is how many reports a player can get before they summon an AuraBot.

# AuraBot Help

An AuraBot is a generated NPC that moves around the player, testing if the player is using killaura (or tp aura).
The AuraBot has no name and default skin.

Commands:

> /aurabot <name> - Summons an AuraBot that is assigned to the player, the AuraBot will teleport around the player for 5 seconds. If a player hits the AuraBot too many times then a message will be sent to all players with the permission aurabot.recievenotis (on default the max amount of hits is 35, this can be changed in the config)
  
  Permission: aurabot.summon
  
> /aurabot threshold <int> - Sets the maximum amount of hits a player can get on the AuraBot before all players with the permission aurabot.recievenotis are notified.
  
  Permission: aurabot.managethreshold
